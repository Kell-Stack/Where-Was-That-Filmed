## Implementation

I used data from  ```https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am``` which provided me with a listing of filming locations of movies shot in San Francisco starting from 1924. The data was provided by and last updated on October 27, 2017 by the San Francisco Film Commission.

This project used
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Reactstrap
